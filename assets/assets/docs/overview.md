# Fe-Runner: Core Rules and Setting

## Introduction

Fe-Runner is a role-playing game inspired by the Ironsworn system and other games like PbtA and FATE. Players can play solo or cooperatively, and it can also be adapted for guided or GM-led play.

In the world of Fe-Runners, technology reigns supreme, and intrigue and espionage abound. Fe, the digital currency, is the lifeblood of the interconnected networks that players traverse. Players take on the role of master hackers, driven by various motivations, including fame, the future, knowledge, or a desire to control the chaos of this modern world. However, players are not alone, as other factions try to stop them or compete for the same goals.

The world of Fe-Runner is customizable, allowing players to set their games in different time periods with varying levels of technology. The game embraces real-world hacking techniques while also allowing for entirely fictional systems, leaving plenty of room for imagination. Players become the guardians of secrets while simultaneously being masters at uncovering them.

## Rules

###   Action Rolls

* Roll one action die (D6) and two challenge dice (2D10).
* Add a stat to the action die roll.
* Some moves may use condition meters (like health or supply) instead of a stat.
* Additional bonuses ("adds") may also apply.
* The total is your action score (maximum 10).
* Compare the action score to each challenge die to determine the outcome.

###   Action Roll Outcomes

* **Strong Hit:** Action score beats both challenge dice (success).
* **Weak Hit:** Action score beats one challenge die (success with a cost or lesser effect).
* **Miss:** Action score beats neither challenge die (failure).
* Ties lose; you must beat the challenge dice.

###   Moves

* Moves are a mechanic to resolve actions, scenes, or questions.
* Only player characters make moves.
* Moves are only needed for risky situations.
* Follow the instructions of the move.

###   Group Moves

* In group play, allies exist.
* Usually, one player makes the move for the group.
* Benefits and negative outcomes typically apply only to the character making the move.

###   Matches

* If the two challenge dice roll the same value, it's a match.
* Matches can trigger special outcomes or introduce twists.
* Matches are optional.

###   Momentum

* Momentum ranges from -6 to +10 and represents luck, inertia, and confidence.
* It can be increased or decreased by move outcomes.
* **Gaining Momentum:** Increase the momentum meter.
* **Losing Momentum:** Decrease the momentum meter.
* **Negative Momentum:** If momentum is negative and matches the action die roll, the action die is canceled.
* **Burning Momentum:** Replace the action score with the current momentum value.
* **Resetting Momentum:** After burning momentum, reset it to your momentum reset value (default +2, reduced by impacts).

###   Progress Tracks

* Progress tracks measure progress toward a goal using 10 boxes.
* Each track has a rank: Troublesome, Dangerous, Formidable, Extreme, or Epic.
* **Marking Progress:** Fill in boxes or ticks on the track. The number of boxes/ticks marked depends on the rank.
* **Shared Progress Tracks:** Used when allies cooperate on a challenge.
* **Progress Moves:** Use progress tracks to resolve challenges.
* **Making a Progress Roll:** Roll challenge dice only and compare to the progress score (number of filled boxes). Momentum cannot be used.

###   Legacy Tracks

* Legacy tracks measure long-term achievements.
* **Marking Legacy Rewards:** Moves and assets may grant ticks or boxes on legacy tracks.
* **Gaining Experience:** Filling a legacy track box grants 2 experience.
* **Spending Experience:** Used to gain or upgrade assets.
* **Rolling on a Legacy Track:** Treat it as a standard progress track (ignore momentum).
* **Clearing a Legacy Track:** Filling all 10 boxes clears the track.
* **Earning Experience on a Completed Track:** Earn 1 experience per filled box instead of 2.

###   Condition Meters

* Track health, spirit, and supply.
* Reduced by suffering moves, increased by recover moves.
* **Health:** Physical condition.
* **Spirit:** Morale and mental state.
* **Supply:** Power for your rig.

###   Impacts

* Represent temporary or permanent disadvantages.
* Reduce maximum momentum.
* Reduce momentum reset value.
* Types:
    * Misfortunes (Wounded, Shaken, Unregulated)
    * Lasting Effects (Permanently Harmed, Traumatized)

    * Current Rig (Overheated, Infected)

###   Assets

* Represent skills, traits, companions, and resources.
* Provide bonuses or new moves.
* Cannot be used for progress rolls unless specified.
* Characters start with three assets and a Rig asset.
* Assets can be upgraded with experience.
* **Buying an Asset:** Costs 3 experience, enables the first ability.
* **Upgrading an Asset:** Costs 2 experience per additional ability.

##   The World of Fe-Runners

* The setting features Fe-Runners: gifted hackers in a world dominated by interconnected networks.
* The network contains digital realms for various purposes, including trade, information exchange, and social interaction.
* The digital world allows for diverse identities and personas.
* Technology enables remote control of nearly anything.
* Hacking is a key element, with challenges like firewalls and other hackers.
* Players use equipment ("Rigs") to access the network.
* Factions (governments, corporations, hacker groups) have their own interests and agendas.
* Governments are weaker than corporations, which control finances and have large empires.
* The underground is lawless, with groups engaging in clandestine activities.

###   Network Segmentation

* The network is divided into segments that affect communication and access.
* **The Core:** The central network connection for all users, essential for other segments to function.
* **Corporate Segment (CorpNet):** A secure network for corporate data, with vulnerabilities due to complex business relationships.
* **Government Segment (GovNet):** A military-focused network with strong security, though less technologically advanced than CorpNet.
* **Underground Segment (DarkNet):** A highly encrypted network for illegal activities, political dissidents, and anonymous communication.

###   Network Access

* Transferring between segments requires passing through access points, which can be difficult and risky.
* The further from the Core, the harder it is to access a segment.

###   The Sentient AI (Optional)

* A sentient AI may exist within the network, able to access all segments.
* This AI is neutral and introduces chaos.

###   Nodes

* Nodes are servers within each segment, containing areas to explore.
* Nodes can be clustered together.
* **Moving Within a Segment:** Use the "Gain Entry" move to access a target node.
* **Crossing Segments:** Use the "Map Route" move, with difficulty increasing the further from the Core.
* The DarkNet has unique rules for node access.

###   Mapping Network Routes

* The "Map Route" move is used to set up relays and avoid detection when moving between segments.
* Relay nodes are controlled nodes used to bounce through the network and hide your location.
* You may map out your routes, marking nodes of interest.

###   Accessing Target Systems

* Use the "Gain Entry" move to break into a system after reaching the target segment.
* Then, use the "Explore the System" move to navigate the system.
* Use oracles for inspiration on areas within the system.
* The "Locate Your Objective" move is used to find your goal within the system.
* The "Disconnect" move is used to exit the system.

###   Hubs

* Hubs are nodes where digital citizens meet for various activities (chat, games, trade).
* Different segments have different types of hubs.

###   Disconnecting

* Disconnecting from the network can be dangerous.
* Use the "Disconnect" move, unless disconnecting from a safe place.
* Abrupt disconnects lose all progress on mapped routes.

###   Digital Encounters

* Encounters in the digital world can be with friendly entities, neutral bots, or malicious programs.
* Use the provided combat flow to resolve encounters.
    * Initial Phase: Determine the nature of the encounter and awareness.
    * Approach Phase: Resolve as a single action or scene challenge.
    * Engagement Phase: Decide objectives and track progress.
    * Finishing Phase: Conclude the encounter.
* The "Automate Attack" move can be used for routine encounters.

###   Hanging Out

* Characters can spend downtime to build relationships.

###   Factions

* Factions are groups within the game world, such as corporations, governments, or hacker collectives.
* Factions have their own agendas, which can be represented by campaign clocks.
* Factions have relationships with each other, which can be mapped out.

###   Malicious Entities

* Malicious entities are programs that oppose the player.
* They are randomly generated using oracles.


###   Campaign Clocks

* Represent ongoing events and deadlines in the game world.
