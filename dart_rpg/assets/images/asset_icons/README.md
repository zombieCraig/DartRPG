# Asset Icons Directory

This directory is used to store icon images for game assets. It is required by the build process and should not be removed.

- Asset icons will be stored here
- The directory is referenced in pubspec.yaml as part of the assets/images/ directory
- This placeholder file ensures the directory is not empty during builds
