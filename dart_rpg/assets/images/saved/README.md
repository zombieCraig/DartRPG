# Saved Images Directory

This directory is used to store images saved by the application. It is required by the build process and should not be removed.

- Images uploaded by users will be stored here
- The directory is referenced in pubspec.yaml as an asset directory
- This placeholder file ensures the directory is not empty during builds
