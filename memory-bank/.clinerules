# Cline Rules for DartRPG Project

## Project Patterns

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: snake_case for file names (e.g., `game_provider.dart`, `logging_service.dart`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase for class names (e.g., `GameProvider`, `LoggingService`)
- **Variables/Methods**: camelCase for variables and methods (e.g., `currentGame`, `saveGame()`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `LEVEL_DEBUG`, `LEVEL_INFO`)
- **Private Members**: Prefix with underscore (e.g., `_games`, `_loadGames()`)

### Code Organization
- **Model Classes**: Located in `lib/models/` directory
- **Provider Classes**: Located in `lib/providers/` directory
- **Screen Widgets**: Located in `lib/screens/` directory
- **Utility Classes**: Located in `lib/utils/` directory
- **Reusable Widgets**: Located in `lib/widgets/` directory

### Design Patterns
- **Provider Pattern**: Used for state management throughout the app
- **Singleton Pattern**: Used for services like `LoggingService`
- **Factory Pattern**: Used in model classes for JSON serialization/deserialization
- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented via `ChangeNotifier` and `Consumer` widgets
- **State Pattern**: Used in the Quest model to manage different quest states

### Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for operations that might fail
- Log errors using the `LoggingService` with appropriate level and context
- Show user-friendly error messages for user-facing errors
- Include stack traces for debugging purposes

## Implementation Paths

### Adding a New Screen
1. Create a new file in `lib/screens/` directory
2. Implement a StatefulWidget or StatelessWidget as appropriate
3. Use `Consumer` widgets to access provider state
4. Add navigation to the new screen from appropriate places

### Adding a New Model
1. Create a new file in `lib/models/` directory
2. Implement the model class with appropriate properties
3. Add JSON serialization/deserialization methods
4. Update relevant providers to use the new model

### Adding a New Feature
1. Identify which layers need to be modified (UI, state, data)
2. Update or create model classes as needed
3. Update or create provider methods as needed
4. Implement UI components to expose the feature
5. Add appropriate error handling and logging

### Logging Best Practices
1. Use appropriate log levels based on message importance
2. Include contextual information (tag, method name)
3. Log exceptions with stack traces
4. Keep log messages clear and informative
5. Avoid logging sensitive information

## User Preferences

### UI/UX Preferences
- Clean, minimalist design
- Intuitive navigation with minimal depth
- Consistent visual language across screens
- Dark mode support is important
- Accessibility considerations (font size, contrast)

### Functionality Preferences
- Offline-first approach
- Data persistence and reliability
- Quick access to frequently used features
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization for mobile devices

## Journal Entry System

### Rich Text Editor
- Custom implementation with markdown-style formatting
- Toolbar with formatting options (bold, italic, headings, lists)
- Support for character and location references using @ and # syntax
- Image embedding support
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (Ctrl+M for Move, Ctrl+O for Oracle, Ctrl+Q for Quests)

### Autocompletion
- Show suggestions after typing @ or # plus one character
- Display inline suggestions as greyed-out text
- Support tab completion for efficiency
- Match on character handle or location name

### Character References
- Use @ syntax with handle-based references
- Automatically generate handle from first name if not provided
- Validate to prevent spaces and special characters in handles
- Format: @handle for characters, #name for locations

### Linked Items Summary
- Collapsible summary below journal entry
- Sections for characters, locations, move rolls, and oracle rolls
- Interactive elements to view details of linked items
- Visual presentation with color coding for move outcomes

## Quest System

### Quest Model
- Implemented in `lib/models/quest.dart`
- Properties include title, rank, progress, status, and notes
- Associated with specific characters
- Status can be Ongoing, Completed, or Forsaken
- Progress tracked on a 10-segment scale

### Quest Screen Organization
- Tab-based UI with three tabs: Ongoing, Completed, Forsaken
- Quests automatically move between tabs based on status changes
- FloatingActionButton for creating new quests
- Card-based UI for displaying quest details

### Quest Progress Tracking
- 10-segment progress bar using ProgressTrackWidget
- Manual adjustment with buttons to increase/decrease progress
- Progress rolls similar to other game mechanics
- Visual feedback on progress changes

### Quest-Journal Integration
- Automatic journal entries for quest status changes
- Quest events recorded in the journal for narrative continuity
- Character association for quest ownership

### Quest Navigation
- Available from bottom navigation bar between Locations and Moves
- Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Q) from Journal Entry screen
- Character filtering for focusing on specific character quests

## Known Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Data Size**: SharedPreferences has limitations for large datasets
- **Performance**: JSON serialization/deserialization can be CPU-intensive
- **Memory Usage**: In-memory logging can consume significant memory
- **Error Handling**: Balancing comprehensive logging with performance
- **Rich Text Persistence**: Storing and retrieving complex formatted text efficiently
- **Image Handling**: Managing embedded images effectively
- **Quest Filtering**: Performance may degrade with large numbers of quests

### UX Challenges
- **Navigation Complexity**: Many screens and features to navigate
- **Information Density**: Balancing detail with clarity
- **Accessibility**: Supporting various user needs
- **Error Messaging**: Providing helpful error messages without technical jargon
- **Autocompletion UX**: Making suggestions helpful without being intrusive
- **Mobile Text Editing**: Optimizing the rich text editor for touch screens
- **Quest Management**: Balancing quest complexity with usability

## Project Evolution

### Recent Focus
- Implementing the Quest system with tabs for different quest statuses
- Enhancing the journal entry system with rich text editing
- Implementing character handle/short name support
- Adding autocompletion for character and location references
- Fixing UI and navigation issues
- Improving search functionality in Moves and Oracles screens

### Current Direction
- Testing and refining the Quest system features
- Optimizing performance for large numbers of quests
