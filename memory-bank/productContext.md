# Product Context: DartRPG

## Purpose & Vision
DartRPG was created to address the need for a digital companion for players of Ironsworn-based RPG systems, particularly the Fe-Runners hacking-themed game. The vision is to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly tool that enhances the tabletop RPG experience by streamlining record-keeping and game mechanics, allowing players to focus more on storytelling and immersion.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Complex Record-Keeping
Tabletop RPGs like Ironsworn involve tracking numerous elements: character stats, progress tracks, relationships, locations, quests, and narrative developments. DartRPG digitizes this record-keeping, reducing the need for physical character sheets and notebooks that can be cumbersome, easily damaged, or lost.

### 2. Game State Management
For solo players or game masters, maintaining the state of the game world can be challenging. DartRPG provides structured organization for game elements, making it easier to remember details and maintain consistency across sessions.

### 3. Accessibility and Portability
Physical RPG materials can be bulky and inconvenient to transport. DartRPG makes the entire game system accessible from a mobile device, allowing players to engage with their games anywhere.

### 4. Dice Rolling and Oracle Consultation
Ironsworn systems rely on dice rolls and oracle tables for game mechanics and narrative prompts. DartRPG integrates these elements directly into the app, eliminating the need for physical dice and reference books.

### 5. Session Continuity
Players often struggle to remember what happened in previous sessions, especially if there are long gaps between play. The journal system in DartRPG helps maintain narrative continuity by providing a searchable record of past events.

### 6. Quest Tracking
Keeping track of multiple quests, their progress, and outcomes can be difficult with traditional pen and paper methods. DartRPG's quest system provides a structured way to manage ongoing adventures, completed quests, and abandoned storylines.
