# Progress Report: DartRPG

## Current Status

The DartRPG application is in active development with core functionality implemented and working. The application provides a digital companion for Ironsworn-based RPG systems, with a focus on the Fe-Runners hacking-themed game. Recent work has focused on implementing a network graph visualization for locations to better represent the hacking-themed world of Fe-Runners.

**Overall Progress**: ~80% complete towards initial release
